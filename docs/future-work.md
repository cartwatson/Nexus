# Future Work

- Database
    - add more columns as needed to `droids` and `satellites`
    - init tables script, weird approach, would spend more time learning a cleaner solution
- Mission Control Station
    - ability to handle multiple droids
        - add droids to system while up to ensure no downtime/missed contacts
    - ability to handle request priority
        - should be able to give a request a certain priority
            - currently sorted by time, first come first serve
- Satellite
    - Make port assignment dynamics so multiple "satellites/droids" can be used at once
        - This would be necessary for MCS to support multiple satellites at once
        - All systems would need minor touchups but they were built with this idea in mind
            - MCS would require the most significant rework
            - Satellite would likely take the role of simulating contact with mcs using the random sleep timer
            - API should be mostly updated for this already, but it may be useful to change how `/images` behaves by default
            - Database is good to go as is
    - Enhanced file naming, include date & time when the image was taken
        - This would allow more than one image of a satellite at a time
- API
    - Enforce request type for security purposes
    - Ability to upload images directly to db with `/images`
    - Enforce satellite naming conventions via regex, currently `""` is a valid object name
- Misc.
    - Some chunks of code are reused throughout multiple files/containers there may be benefit in consolidating some aspects (eg: MCS and API both reuse the same block to connect to and validate the database)
        - This could be done with the creation of a package/gem/crate/etc
    - Automate creation of pgadmin server and incorporate that into "build-and-run.sh"
    - Create an automated testing suite
