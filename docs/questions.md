# Questions/Clarifications

- API
  - *req 3:* is "DROID" a specific hardcoded tracked satellite?
  - *req 2:* should there be an image id associated with the images from a particular satellite or should it be all images from a particular satellite
  - *db:*    error handling? what should be done for that case?

## Notes about future work

- DB
  - ability to expand to have multiple "DROID"s
  - init tables script, weird approach, would spend more time learning the "right way"
  - not 100% certain of my use of HTTP codes; eg: 204
