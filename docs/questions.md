# Questions/Clarifications

- API
  - *req 3:* is "DROID" a specific hardcoded tracked satellite?
  - *req 2:* should there be an image id associated with the images from a particular satellite or should it be all images from a particular satellite

## Notes about future work

- DB
  - init tables script, weird approach, would spend more time learning the "right way"
